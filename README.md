# DeepLearningBaseline

ðŸ§  Deep Learning Project Template
This is a modular and scalable setup template for deep learning projects, designed to improve code readability, reusability, and development speed.

Key features:

- Well-structured project layout for clear separation of concerns

- Modular structure for easy navigation and maintenance: dataset loading, model definition, training, evaluation, and inference

- YAML-based configuration system for flexible experimentation

- Integrated logging and visualization tools

- Support for multiple deep learning frameworks

- Comprehensive documentation and examples

- Easy to extend, understand, and integrate into new or existing workflows

This template serves as a foundation for building robust deep learning applications, enabling developers to focus on model development rather than boilerplate code.

## TODO

- add test cases in the future

## Set up + Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

#### 1.1. Clone the repository using git

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LeHoang510/DeepLearningBaseline.git
cd DeepLearningBaseline
```

#### 1.2. Folder structure

The folder structure of the project in the [structure.md](docs/structure.md) . The folder structure is designed to be flexible and easy to use. You can add your own scripts in the `train`, `test`, and `inference` directories. You can also add your own data in the `data` directory.

### 2. Create a conda environment

#### 2.1. Create a conda environment with the required packages

- You can create a conda environment or use an existing one or use a virtual environment. To create a conda environment, run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Create and activate a conda environment
    conda create -n <env-name> python=<python-version>
    conda activate <env-name>

    # Example:
    conda create -n dl python=3.10
    conda activate dl
    ```

#### 2.2. Install the required packages

Use one of the following methods to install the required packages. You can use `uv` or `poetry` to manage your dependencies. Both methods will create a `pyproject.toml` file in the root directory of the project.

#### 2.2.1. Install the required packages using uv

- You can install the required packages using uv. To do this, run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Install uv
    pip install uv
    ```

- Install the required packages using uv:

    ```bash
    # Install specific package
    uv pip install <package-name>

    # Example:
    uv pip install numpy
    ```

- Add dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file as needed:

    ```bash
    # Add specific package to pyproject.toml
    uv add <package-name>

    # Example:
    uv add numpy
    ```

- Install the dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file for existing projects:

    ```bash
    # Install all dependencies in requirements.txt
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### 2.2.2. Install the required packages using poetry

- You can install the required packages using poetry. To do this, run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Install poetry
    pip install poetry
    ```

- Add dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file as needed:

    ```bash
    # Add specific package to pyproject.toml
    poetry add <package-name>

    # Example:
    poetry add numpy
    ```

- Add source to the `pyproject.toml` file as needed:

    ```bash
    # Add specific source to pyproject.toml
    poetry source add --priority=explicit <source-name> <source-url>
    poetry add --source <source-name> <package-name>

    # Example:
    poetry source add --priority=explicit pytorch https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    poetry add --source pytorch torch
    ```

- Install the dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file for existing projects:

    ```bash
    # Install all dependencies in pyproject.toml
    poetry install
    ```

### 2.3. Turn project into a package

- Turn the project into a package by running the following command:

    ```bash
    # Turn the project into a package
    pip install -e .
    ```

### 2.4. Check hardware compatibility

- You can check if your hardware is compatible by running the following command (only with torch installed):

    ```bash
    # Check hardware compatibility
    python utils/check_hardware.py
    ```

## Quick start

This section will guide you through the quick start of the project. The project is designed to be flexible and easy to use. You can run the training, testing, and inference scripts with minimal configuration.

In order to write your own training, testing, and inference scripts, you can refer to the existing scripts or the template scripts. You can also refer to the [GUIDE.md](docs/guide.md)  file for more details on how to write your own scripts.

### 1. Run the training script

- You can run the training script by running the command below. Modify verbose=False to verbose=True to see more details of hardware information during training process. The output in the terminal will show the training progress and the logs will be saved in the `logs/train/<timestamp>` directory and the model checkpoints as well as the config file and tensorboard logs will be saved in the `outputs/train/<experiment-name>` directory.:

    ```bash
    # Train the model
    python train/<train-script>.py

    # Example:
    python train/mnist_train.py
    ```

- The training script will automatically delete the previous experiment with the same name in the `outputs/train/` directory. If you want to keep the previous experiment, you can change the experiment name in the config.

### 2. Run the test script

- You can run the test script by running the command below:

    ```bash
    # Test the model
    python test/<test-script>.py

    # Example:
    python test/mnist_test.py
    ```

### 3. Run the inference script

- You can run the inference script by running the command below:

    ```bash
    # Inference the model
    python inference/<inference-script>.py

    # Example:
    python inference/mnist_inference.py
    ```

### 4. Run the tensorboard

- You can run the tensorboard by running the following command:

    ```bash
    # Run tensorboard to visualize the training logs
    tensorboard --logdir=outputs/train/<experiment-name>

    # Example:
    tensorboard --logdir=outputs/train/mnist_experiment
    ```

### 5. Extra commands

- **Clean**:  You can clean up the outputs or logs by running the following command. Just make sure to well define the path in the `clean.py` script. This will delete all the outputs in the `outputs/` directory:

    ```bash
    # Clean up
    python scripts/clean.py
    ```

- **Visualize**: You can visualize the images in the dataset by running the following command. Just make sure to well define the path in the `visualize.py` script and the logic for visualization. This will visualize the images in the dataset and save them in the `outputs/visualize/` directory:

    ```bash
    # Visualization
    python src/visualize/visualize.py
    ```

- **Config Validation**: You can validate the config file by running the following command. This will check if the config file is valid and if all the required fields are present:

    ```bash
    # Validate config
    python src/utils/validate_config.py
    ```

## How to write your own scripts

You can write your own training, testing, and inference scripts by following the template scripts in the `train`, `test`, and `inference` directories. You can also refer to the [guide.md](docs/guide.md) for more details on how to write your own scripts.
